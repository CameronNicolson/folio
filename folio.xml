 <title>Introduction</title>
 <para>
		 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology, transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, media, and customer service <citation linkend="scotgov-spice-ai-healthcare" />

	 Many organisations are integrating AI into their operations to enhance effeciency and productivity. Additionally, new applications and markets have emerged, in part due to AI, such as self-driving cars and virtual assistants. AI has gone mainstream, its effect are being felt by most people, whether they are aware of it or not.
	 </para>
	 <para>
	 to AI is an emerging technogy and produced bundles of new applications and markets, such as self-driving vehicles.  Histronically speaking, AI has spent a large part of its life being unrefined and lacking in pratical use, once commonly existance as a theorised standard.  
		 <para>
		AI has been in development for over 70 years, emerging around the same time as the formal establishment of Computer Science as an academic discipline. While AI has experienced steady growth, today’s emerging trends have accelerated both its development and application, compelling market leaders to embrace AI, the UK Government is one such stakeholder.
		 </para>
		 <para>
			 The Cabinet of the United Kingdom, under both Labour and Conservaative governments, recognised the technological step change and pledged investments in AI development. The Conservative-led government allocated £900 million to various British AI projects, citing economic growth as a key incentive. 
		 </para>
		 <para>
		 In 2025, the government support for AI reached new heights when the Prime Minister announced initiatives to position AI as a central pillar of the UK's economic transformation and the securement of £14 billion worth of investments from the private sector. Keir Starmer, speaking on behalf of his government, declared Britain's ambition to become "one of the great AI superpowers" <citation linkend="pm-ai-speech2025"/>. 
	 </para>
	 <para>
		 Alongside the announced investments, the Prime Minister stated that the government's strategy to embrace AI would "improve public services" and, in turn, transform the lives of working groups, with a specific focus on teachers. Given that teachers make up a large portion of public employees in the UK, this example was an important and relevant point to highlight, especially as public schooling faces increasing challenges. 
	 </para>
		  <para>
	 In recent years, the attractivness of teaching has fallen across Britain and working conditions have changed.
	 Education and schooling is one of the UK's core public services, with over 29,000 schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The sector employs around 1.23 million people, making up approximately 20% of the UK’s 6.12 million public sector workforce.	
			  Within Scotland, staffing saw a steady increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, which currently stands at 13.3 students per teacher. Together with a rise in teachers leaving before completing their five-year tenure, according to the latest figures <citation linkend="stv-teachers-leaving" />. 
		  </para>
		  <para>
		 England faces a similar situation with 90% of teachers saying they have considered leaving their jobsdue ot high workloads, and contending with recruitment shortages. These reports come from the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). 
		  </para>
		  <para>
			  The government aimed to tackle the situation by giving £1 million <citation linkend="govuk-one-million-ai-teaching-tools" /> in funding to 16 tech companies to build AI teaching tools. This investment has yielded tangable prototypes to date. The initiative is guided by the AI Opportunities Action Plan <citation linkend="ai-opportunities-action-plan" />, devised by the government's AI adviser, Matt Clifford. According to the document, with the newly created AI deployment, public services should be its primary customer. Consequently, the government is positioning itself as both a mass producer and user of AI.
	 </para>
	 <para>
			 The National Education Union (NEU) <citation linkend="neu-ai-education" /> opposed any move to prioritize AI technologies at the expense of teacher employment, citing real concerns over potential job losses. They also argued that such tools could devalue the profession by shifting teachers' roles from crafting high-quality lessons to merely administering the technology itself. 
Responding to the news, the NEU's general secretary criticized the exclusion of teaching experts from rollout decisions, stating that "there had not been any meaningful discussion with the sector yet" <citation linkend="skynews-neu-job-loss-fears" />.
</para>
		 replying to the news that the Department for Education was "running away with itself." This comes with claims from elsewhere that education centres had not been involved in the decisions.  
	 </para>
		  <para>
The proof-of-concept AI tool, developed by Faculty for the Department of Education <citation linkend="dofe-technical-report-ai-use" />, explored the use of generative AI in evaluating lower-level English literacy material. It successfully provided feedback using generative AI (GPT-4-turbo), and teachers generally found it highly useful, with some appreciating its time-saving aspects. While the associated press release <citation linkend="govuk-press-release-teachers-ai-tools-homework" /> highlighted the tool’s potential for high accuracy, the more detailed findings in the technical report, absent from the press release, revealed a decline in error-spotting accuracy when processing longer, more complex pieces of writing.
		  </para>
		  While the AI tool demonstrated a high level of accuracy on isolated sentences, the performance did decrease when applied to longer and more complex pieces of writing like the 20-sentence essays and the synthetic pupil essays. This suggests that factors such as increased text length and the presence of multiple, potentially overlapping errors can pose challenges for the error detection pipeline
  <para> 
	  Two government-sponsored AI applications have reached the testing stage: a student marking tool designed to provide 'tailored feedback' on student work—including handwritten and pictorial submissions—and a lesson plan generator. During user testing, participants recognized the AI’s instrumental value and expressed a willingness to use it again.
  </para>
  <para>
Both applications leverage generative AI—a term consistent with the DfE's classification of such tools—a subclass of artificial intelligence specifically designed to analyse public data and generate meaningful outputs.
  </para>

	  <title>What is Generative AI?</title>
	  <para>Generative AI, also referred to as GenAI, creates content, commonly text and audio, based on inputs by the users. To create useful content, the AI relies on deep learning models, 

	  artificial intelligence is trained on vast datasets mostly to favour accuracy of facts, diverse viewpoints and quality of the responses. LLMs can be thought as speaking to someone who has studied to become an expert in a field, more often than not, experts give insightful answers on their specialised subject compared with others. 
	  The consumer market was adorned with AI assistants in recent decades, popular choices being Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. Aside from the hands-free utilitarian progress, the evolution in AI was creating computers that qualified for the Turing Test --a thought experiment created by Alan Turing to-- sporting a virtual helper who vocalised their answers, with a natural sounding voice.

	 Education and schooling is one of the UK's core public services, with the UK as a whole responsible for over 29,000 schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, filled with a workforce that makes up 25% of the UK's 6.12 million total across all sectors.

		The plan for the UK Government is to implement the AI oppurtunities Action Plan, set out by Matt Clifford, which contains 50 recommendations 
	 The government has commited to take forward the AI Oppurtunities Action Plan and its 50 recommendations. The action plan details a number of key industries, including healthcare, private 
	 In the government’s proposed initiatives, explicitly mentioned was a direction for teachers to be supported by AI, such as admin tasks. In additional, educators were advised to step-up AI curriculum to students.
